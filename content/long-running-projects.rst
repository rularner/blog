I've been working for over two years now on a project called Transit Agent.  At the begining it was just something for me to learn HTML5, Google App Engine, JQuery, and see what I could build into a mobile application.  The plan was to develop something quickly in HTML5, and then perhaps build it into an iPhone app.  (At the time there were very few CalTrains apps in the appstore)  I worked on it for about a month, but then got distracted by life events.  (To be specific, I got serious with my then-girlfriend and proposed.  Silly her, she said yes!)

One year later I came back to Transit Agent.  At that point I decided that I was going to make it open-source; however, the code was in an embarrasing state.  (#1 on the not-completed list: tests.  *sigh*)  This time I knew it was a bit of a race - my wife was pregnant and my daughter was due shortly.  I added Behaviour-Driven Tests based on Cucumber and was working to get it ready to open source... and then my daughter was born three weeks early.  (Yes, she's fine - but she is also my new personal project!)

So, Transit Agent still languishes.  However, I don't view it as a failed project - I learned each time I go back to it, and it will make it out some day.
